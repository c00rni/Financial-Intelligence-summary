### 5 - Profit Is a estimate

#### A (Very) little accounting

Income statement is supposed to show a company's profit for a given period. It does not track the which get in and out because this is the job of the cash flow statement.

Income staement start with sales and follow with cost lines. The cost registered for the given period are not a reflection of the reality but rather the cost and expenses needed to make the sales in the given period.

**Matching Principle**
Match the cost with its associated revenue to determine profits in a given period of time. The job of an accountant is the figure out and properly record all the costs incurred in generating sales.

#### The purpose of the income statement

Income statement tries to measure whether the products of services that a company provides are profitable. It's the accountants best effort to show the sales done during a time period and the cost generated to make those sales and the profits are the left over.

Managers should know the income statement because they need to know what is profitable and what is not in their business to able to make decision.

```
Example:

A product owner of a software should know what type of feature are mostly use so he can better serve customers and increase profitability in the future. 
```

Income statement show profits but do not show if the company will be able to pay its biils, beacause it caculate estimations

### 6 - Cracking the code of the income statment

Income statement can often seems liek a code that needs to be deciphered. Accountant put complicated labels in their income statements and their can be pages long.

#### Reading an income statement

All of these mean **Income statement** :
- profit and loss statatement
- P&L statement,
- operating statement
- earning statement
- statement of earning
- statement of operaitons

Title often contain "consolidated".

#### What ot's measuring

Income statement can eb division of a business, a large compagny, a business unit, a indivual store.

Once the relevant entity is identified, the time period must be found. An income statement can be on an week, month or a year.

#### "Actual" versus "Pro forma"

**Non-GAAP :** Income statement that may exucle any unusual or one-time charges. They reflect reality, but are for the most part incomes statement strip off of all the bad things.

**Pro-forma :** Pro-format means that the income statment is a projection. Thier are educated guess about the future.

#### The Big Numbers

The most important number are :
 - Sale / Revenu which are always at the top.
 - Cost and expenses in the middle (COGS, COS, Cost of revenue)
 - Profit at the bottom

#### Comparative Data

Consolidated income statement generally reflect what happended during a time period.

There are generally compose of 3 colomns although internal income statement can have many more.

```text
Actual % of sales           Budget % of sales           Variance %

-----

Actual previous period      $ Change (+/-)              % Change
```

The goal of those income statment is to show how the company is doing compareed with last quartier of last year.

#### Footnotes

Footnotes are informations that accountant think everybody shoud be aware of. They must be red carefully to understand how the numbers were determined.

### One Big Rule

Income statement reflect estimates and assumptions.
Read footnotes carefully


### 7 - Revenue - The isssue is recognition

A company can record or recognize a sale when it delivers a product of service to a customer.

#### Murky guileline

GAAP guideline regonize sale only when the work have been performed

#### Possibilities for manipulation ()

Earning per share = profit divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Earning recognition is the most used data for manipulation.

#### Backlog and bookings

Backlog refer to no yet recongnized sales (aka orders that have been signed but not yet started or not yet reconignized revenue).

#### Deferred revenue

Deferred revenue is when a service is already paid but not delivered. US GAAP expect a service to be delivered to take into account earning. Therfore deferred revenu will appear in balance sheet as liability (money owe to customers, until the service delivered).

### 8 - Costs and expenses - NO hard-and-Fast Rules

#### Cost of goods sold or cost of services

Expenses fall into tow categories:
- Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS) / Cost of service (COS)
- Operatiing expenses

```text
COGS definition:
Cost of good sold include every expenses made directly involved in producingn a product/ delivering a service.
```

```text
Above the line definition:
The "line" refer to gross profit. Above the line are COGS or COS and below the line are operating expenses, interest, and taxes. Items above the line tned to vary more in the short term.
```

#### Operating expenses

Operating expenses are cost that are not directly related to making the product. Sales General and administrative expenses (SG&A or just G&A).

Usally includes:
- rent
- utilities
- telephone
- research
- marketing
- management and staff salaries
- HR
- accounting
- IT

#### The power of depreciation and amortization

Deprciation spread an expense for an asset on several time period. Amortization is the same thing for intangible assets. Both are noncash expense.

Items sucha as patents, copyrights and good will are all untangibles assets that appear in the balance sheets.

#### One-time charges : Yellow flag

One time charge that do not fall into COGS or operating expense either. Those epenses appear in the one-time charge line of the income statement.

#### Tracking expenses differently depending on who's looking

Numbers are presented differently depending who will read them. In public GAP income statement the categories may be:
- Cost of goods sold
- Selling, general and administrative
- Other operating charges
- Interest expenses
- Income taxes

In the other hand manager would whant to know how much they are spending on:
- Each ingrediant used to make a beverages, broken down by beverage,
- all the cost related to dlivering the producst
- departmental costs, such as accouting, human resources, IT
- Sales and marketing cost broken down by product, advertising campaign

### 9 - The Many forms of profit

#### Gross profit: how much is enough ?

Gross profit = Revenu - COGS/COS

Gross profit do not include operating expenses.

```text
Profit is the amout left after expenses are subtracted form revenue. There are three basic types of profit: gross profit, operating profit, and net profit. Each one is determined by subtracting certain categories of expenses form revenue.
```

#### Operating profit is a key to health ()

Operating profit = Gross profit - operating expenses / SG&A (including depreciation/amortization)

Operating profit is also know as Eearnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

EBITDA = Gross profit - operating expenses / SG&A (excluding interest, taxes, depreciation/amortization)
EBITDA is prefered to gauge entreprise financial well being because compagnies used depreciation and one-time charge to manipulate they profits.

#### Net profit and bow to fix it

Net profit is the bottom line of the financial statement. It's the revenue once all costs and exnpenses are subtracted. Expenses can be :
- cost of goods sold / cost of services
- operating expenses
- one-time charges
- noncash expenses (depreciation / amortization)
- interest
- taxes

#### Contribution margin - a different way of lokking at profit

Contribution margin = revenu - variable cost. It show the profit earn on what have been sell without fix expenses directly related to sells.

#### The impoact of exchange rates on profitability ()

#### PROFIT AT NONPROFITS

Nonpfit organization use the same financial statement as for-profit organization. Non profit organization need money to survive, they are also called "nontaxes organizations" because they dont pay taxes.
